# Overview 
We are a group of property investment advisors, who prepared this short presentation in order to answer three of the most common questions, posed by individuals considering entering the property market for the first time. 
As per request, we conducted a property market research on Ames, in the State of Iowa, in the USA.
With a population of more the 66.5K, one of the Lowest unemployment Rates in the US, and a job market increase of 2.3% over the last year, Ames is a great place to invest in properties, whether you want to buy for rental or resale purposes. 
We analysed a data set containing 1460 properties in Ames, in order to answer three fundamental questions regarding what features should be considered when purchasing a property in the region.

# Methodology and Findings
We used  linear regression and multiple regression to fit our data set from three angles: 

From the analysis of Neighbourhood and Zone, we found that zone is not a good predictor for Sale Prices. The same applies for Neighborhood, thus we suggest that potential buyers should focus on other aspects of the property if their intention is buying to resale. 

From the analysis of overall quality and condition of the property, we found that the overall condition of the property is a good predictor of Sales Prices. This is not the case for the condition. Thus, it is possible to argue that if potential buyers are looking into buying for refurbishment and sale, they should ensure they invest in quality materials.

Finally, our statistical models indicate that if the potential buyers wish to take on renovation projects, they should consider projects including: fireplaces and paved entry; and to avoid projects including increasing the number of parking spaces in the garage, or give the garage a finish.
